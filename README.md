A **simple**, **powerful** starter kit for **modern** JS web development. This was created primarily for educational purposes, but it can be used to bootstrap production-grade web Applications.

##Features
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), for bundling
* [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), through [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) & [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), for ES6 and ES7 support
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), using Airbnb's popular [configuration](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb)
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) for future-proof CSS, including:
  * [PreCSS](https://github.com/jonathantneal/precss), which allows for Sass-like markup
  * [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), so you can just name your classes intuitively
  * [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), for automated cross-browser compatibility
  * [CSSNext](http://cssnext.io/), for CSS4 goodies
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) unit testing, with [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) testing utilities for React

##Stuff Not Included

* [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
